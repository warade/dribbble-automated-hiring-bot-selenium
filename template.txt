Hi (x),
I'm Alex, and I'm building a Design team in Bangalore for our new Consumer FinTech startup (we are in stealth right now).  We are building an innovative financial app for US consumers.
I previously led Product Growth at Amazon Music and I was a Senior Product manager at Yahoo. I strongly believe in the importance of excellence in design - graphic, UI and UX.
I've seen your work and wanted to reach out to see if we could work together.
We're looking for people who want to build a consumer facing product for the US market, and want the opportunity to make a name for themselves in the global design community.  
If you're interested, please ping me and we'll find some time to connect.
Thanks,
Alex
